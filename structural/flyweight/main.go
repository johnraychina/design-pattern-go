package main

// Flyweight is a structural design pattern that allows programs
// to support vast quantities of objects by keeping their memory
// consumption low.

// The pattern achieves it
// by sharing parts of object state between multiple objects.
// In other words, the Flyweight saves RAM
// by caching the same data used by different objects.
// 减小内存消耗，让大量对象共享相同部分的内存.
// 例子：CS游戏，玩家的皮肤，可以共享
